Turnkey Linux Redmine v1.3.2 TKLPatch
=====================================

This is a TKLPatch for the [Turnkey Linux Redmine VM](http://www.turnkeylinux.org/redmine). It updates the VM from the ancient version that it was originally built with to the latest, which at the time of writing is v1.3.2.

Applying the TKLPatch
---------------------
It's possible to apply this patch straight from GitHub. Read the instructions here: http://www.turnkeylinux.org/docs/tklpatch/apply#Applying%20a%20patch%20from%20GitHub%20source

Disclaimer
----------
I've tested this TKLPatch on my own VM. It works. That doesn't mean it'll work for you, but there's a pretty good chance you'll come out smelling of roses. Either way, **TAKE A SNAPSHOT OF YOUR VM BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING**. 

That said, if this patch trashes your Redmine installation, fries your motherboard, drinks your beer, steals your granny and sells her on eBay, it's not my fault! You have been warned!
